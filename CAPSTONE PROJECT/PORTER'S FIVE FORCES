PORTER'S FIVE  FORCES ANALYSIS FOR AGROHAVEN

The Threat Of New Entrants: 

Agro haven is a mobile application designed to directly connect farmers with consumers, facilitating farm-to-consumer sales. Farmers lack a direct and efficient platform to connect with consumers, leading to limited market reach and potentially lower profits. Additionally, consumers often struggle to find fresh, locally sourced produce so this application would help to mitigate the problem faced between farmers and buyers.

 
Bargaining Power Of Buyers (Consumers): 

 The bargaining power of buyers is high as they seek specialized content that addresses their daily nutritional needs. They can easily switch to other apps at little or no cost if they arenâ€™t satisfied.

  
Bargaining Power Of Suppliers (Farmers, Traders): 

The bargaining power of suppliers is moderate as there is the need for a constant supply of foodstuffs for consumers daily 


Threat Of Substitutes:

 The threat of substitutes for AgroHaven would include:

 Established farmers may be hesitant to adopt a new platform, especially if their current methods are sufficient.

Government initiatives supporting farmers could compete with AgroHaven's services, especially if they offer similar benefits at a lower cost.


Existing organizations connecting farmers with resources could be a substitute, particularly if they're well-established and trusted.


 Farmers might cut back on discretionary spending, leading them to avoid new platforms like AgroHaven.


A shift towards organic or locally sourced produce could make AgroHaven's focus (depending on its specific offerings) less appealing.


 New regulations on agricultural practices or data privacy could limit AgroHaven's ability to operate or increase its operating costs.
