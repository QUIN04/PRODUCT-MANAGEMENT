# GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

### Go-to-market strategy for a mental health application for teenage male

| Strategy Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Understanding our audience | We'll initiate an extensive market research project to understand the mental health challenges faced by teenage males and tailor our application to meet their needs. This will also involve studying their online habits, preferences, and behaviors. |
| Building partnerships | We'll collaborate with schools, sports clubs, and youth organizations that have direct access to our target audience. These partnerships will help us reach our audience effectively and gain credibility for our brand and product. |
| Influencer marketing | We'll work with young influencers passionate about mental health. Their endorsement can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health and make our app more appealing. We'll select influencers whose values align with ours and who command respect among teenagers. |
| Educational content | We'll create engaging and informative content, like blog posts, videos, and infographics, that educate our audience about mental health and highlight the benefits of our app. This content will be shared on social media platforms popular among teenagers. |
| Free trial | We'll offer a free trial period to let potential users experience the benefits of the app firsthand. This lowers the barrier to entry and increases the chances of them becoming paid users. During this trial, we'll actively seek feedback to improve their experience. |
| User feedback | We'll collect and act on user feedback regularly through surveys, in-app prompts, and engagement with our users to ensure our app continues to meet their changing needs and expectations. |
